# Family Map
This project, developed for CS 240, features a Java-based server and an Android mobile app inspired by platforms like FamilySearch or Ancestry.

The app generates a randomly created family tree for users, providing names and locations for significant life events of their family members. The main map allows users to select specific events and visualize connections between parents, spouses, and other life events. Additionally, the app includes a detailed page for each family member, displaying all their life events and immediate family connections. Users can also search for specific individuals and life events within the app.

## Project Components
**Server** - 
The back-end web server is built in Java and handles all requests made by the app. A web interface is available for manually issuing requests for testing purposes. There is no pre-built version of the server included, so to test the app, you can run the server in your preferred Java IDE or compile it yourself.

**Client** - 
The Android mobile app provides the features described above. No APK is pre-built for this project. You can run the app on an Android emulator, such as those available in Android Studio, or build the APK and install it on your own device.
